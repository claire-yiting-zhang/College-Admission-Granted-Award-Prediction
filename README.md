# UCLA Econ 187 Project 2


Using the Grants Awarded dataset, we analyzed the factors that affect grants awarded for college admission. We also investigated the model performance and found that GAM generates the best accuracy.


For the second part of our project, we aimed to determine the factors that influence the wine quality the most. From our models, we can conclude that the percent alcohol content of the wine (alcohol) and wine additive that contribute to SO2 levels (sulfates) are the two most important variables.
